To install the smqdecode command, copy the script to any directory in your
PATH.

All modules used are core modules (distributed with Perl), and require no
installation.

To use the API, see the manual (smqdecode --man) for additional instructions.

The quarantineck script can be called as a cron job to monitor the quarantine
queue.  It assumes that smqdecode is installed in the same directory.
