smqdecode - sendmail queue decoder


smqdecode allows you to inspect the contents of a sendmail
message queue.  It enables you to:

o decode the metadata of any entry in the queue

o extract the message headers of any entry in the queue

o extract the message body of any entry in the queue - with
  or without headers.

o extract the message transcript, if any, containing errors
  that sendmail has encountered during processing.

These features allow you to extract a message from the queue
for analysis without delivering it.  This is particularly useful
for quarantined messages.

It can be a companion to the sendmail distribution's 'qtool', which
allows you to move/remove messages in a queue, but does not facilitate
analyzing them.

Usage:
     smqdecode --body     --config   --flags   --headers
               --limit-body=[N,none] --message --metadata --skip-busy
               --queue   --warnings  --type=[all,pended,quarantined,temporary]
               --help    --man       --version

     smqdecode --meta x0VKKEWx032646 qfx0VKKEWx032647 /foo/hfx0VKKEWx032649

     smqdecode --headers --body  x0VKKEWx032646

Note that if no message is specified, all messages in the queue
are processed.

smqdecode can also be used as a Perl module which provides an API
for examining messages in a queue.  This is an experimental feature.
Use --man for documentation.
